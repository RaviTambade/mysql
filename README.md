## 👨‍🏫 Mentor’s Note

Dear Student,

Welcome to your journey into the world of **MySQL** — a foundational skill for every aspiring software engineer, backend developer, or data professional.

Learning databases isn’t just about writing queries — it's about learning to **ask the right questions**, **organize the truth**, and **manage information** with precision and care.

I’ve designed this course as a **story** — not a sprint through syntax, but a structured growth journey. We will walk through the *why*, *how*, and *when* of using databases in real-world applications.

## 🧭 What You’ll Learn

From the very basics of MySQL syntax to the deeper understanding of triggers, transactions, and stored procedures, this guide will help you:

- Build strong foundations in **DBMS principles**
- Understand the power of **SQL queries**
- Master **data relationships** using JOINS
- Automate backend logic with **Stored Procedures & Triggers**
- Ensure consistency with **Transactions & Locking**
- Design better systems through **Normalization & Optimization**
